8.4.1.5 Management of the Biometric System configuration

== Issue Description
The reference to the PP_MDF_V3.3 for management of the biometric system is FMT_SMF_EXT.1, while the PP actually uses FMT_SMF.1. Additionally the enabling/disabling of the BAF is incorrectly referencesd as Management Function 23, and the correct reference is 22.

|Original Text
|8.4.1.5 Management of the Biometric System configuration
|The mobile device shall enable/disable the BAF as required by FMT_SMF_EXT.1 (Management function 23), and revoke the BAF as FMT_SMF_EXT.1 (Management Function 46). Any change to the BAF (e.g. adding or revoking templates) requires re-authentication via the Password Authentication Factor as required by FIA_UAU.6.2.
