== Introduction
From the CCDB-established Working Group, the Biometrics Security iTC (BIO-iTC for short) was formed. The BIO-iTC consists of members of Certification Bodies, labs, vendors and academia working together to create requirements for biometric security testing.

To join the BIO-iTC, please send a message to: isec-itc-bio-info@ipa.go.jp

== Current Status
The BIO-iTC has released an updated v1.1 of the PP-Module and Supporting Documents. This version is still dependent on the final release of Mobile Device Fundamentals PP v3.3 (to complete the reference dates), and so is being tagged as v1.1PRE2 (Proposed Update). This release has several udpates based on feedback from lab review of the Supporting Document, PP-Configuration and Toolbox (there are no changes to the PP-Module except the date to match).

This is published for a Proposed Update review period while waiting for the publication of the Base-PP from NIAP. The only change that will be made after that will be the date references for the MDF (no date changes will be made for the PP-Module, it will be left at July 14, 2022).
