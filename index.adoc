== Current Status
While the BIO-iTC is currently reviewing comments that were provided to v1.0 of the PP-Module and related documents. These are currently in the Internal Draft state and are targeted to be release as v1.1.

The chart below shows the expected timeline for producing the v1.1 documents. This will be updated as the review process progresses.
