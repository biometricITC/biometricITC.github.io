== Introduction
From the CCDB-established Working Group, the Biometrics Security iTC (BIO-iTC for short) was formed. The BIO-iTC consists of members of Certification Bodies, labs, vendors and academia working together to create requirements for biometric security testing.

To join the BIO-iTC, please send a message to: px-isec-itc-bio-info@ipa.go.jp

== Current Status
The BIO-iTC has published v1.1 of the PP-Module and Supporting Documents. This version is matched with the final release of Mobile Device Fundamentals PP v3.3. This release has several udpates based on feedback from lab review of the Supporting Document, PP-Configuration and Toolbox.

=== Continuous Multi-Factor Authentication (CMFA) Proposed Work
The BIO-iTC has created a proposed a new scope of work in authentication to create requirements for Continuous Multi-Factor Authentication (CMFA). CMFA uses multiple inputs to generate a trust score of the user over time. This score can be used for many purposes, such as maintaining the unlock state of the device, determining when some information should be made available, or to provide higher assurance based on the metadata of the decision to external systems. 

This work is still in the proposal stage, but the ESR and Overview of the focus of a PP-Module can be found on the link:./CMFA.html[CMFA] page.
