== Introduction
From the CCDB-established Working Group, the Biometrics Security iTC (BIO-iTC for short) was formed. The BIO-iTC consists of members of Certification Bodies, labs, vendors and academia working together to create requirements for biometric security testing.

To join the BIO-iTC, please send a message to: isec-itc-bio-info@ipa.go.jp

== Current Status
The BIO-iTC has released v1.1 of the PP-Module and Supporting Documents. As the expected Base-PP is the Mobile Device Fundamentals PP v3.3, this release is being tagged at the moment as v1.1PRE while waiting for the final release of the Base-PP to ensure that any changes needed to match that final document are in the finished v1.1 release.
